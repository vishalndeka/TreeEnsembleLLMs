Instead, I can try asking Alex who also has knowledge of music in the context. \n2) Is the Rain Song available?

(Alex): To better understand if the "Rain Song" exists or not, asking Alex for its characteristics might help gain further insight into this music piece.

This would require comparing any potential responses with Ben\'s and Alex’s existing information about the song to determine its availability.\n5) Is the immigrant song there?
